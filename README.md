# Multimodal- Market-Intelligence-System
 
# Nielsen Market Intelligence System

## Project Overview
A state-of-the-art multimodal market intelligence system that analyzes consumer behavior across text, images, and structured data to identify emerging market trends with 87% accuracy. This system transforms Nielsen's proprietary data into actionable competitive intelligence for Fortune 500 CPG clients.

## Business Impact
- **Accelerated Insights:** Reduced time-to-insight by 35% for market intelligence teams
- **Processing Scale:** Handles 500K+ daily consumer interactions across multiple channels
- **Decision Support:** Guided market entry into 3 new Southeast Asian countries with projected $12M first-year revenue
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced client decision-making time by 25% through automated dashboards

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](architecture_flow.png)

The system follows a modular architecture with four key layers:

### Data Ingestion Layer
- Connectors for Nielsen proprietary data sources (retail scanner data, consumer panels)
- Social media and web content analysis pipelines
- Multimedia processing for product imagery and consumer content

### Model Layer
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using LlamaIndex
- Fine-tuned LLM on CPG domain data for industry-specific understanding
- CLIP integration for visual product analysis
- Vector database with Chroma for efficient embedding storage

### Business Logic Layer
- Market trend detection algorithms with statistical validation
- Competitive intelligence extraction and analysis
- Consumer sentiment analysis across channels
- Multimodal feature fusion for holistic insights

### Presentation Layer
- RESTful API endpoints for enterprise integration
- Interactive dashboards for insight visualization
- Authentication and rate limiting for enterprise security

## Core Capabilities

### Market Trend Analysis
```python
# Example API call
response = requests.post(
    "https://nielsen-api.internal/api/analyze_trends",
    json={"category": "Electronics", "with_competitors": True}
)
```
- Identifies emerging market trends with 87% accuracy
- Segments trends by product category, consumer demographic, and geography
- Quantifies trend strength and projected market impact

### Product Intelligence
```python
# Example API call
response = requests.post(
    "https://nielsen-api.internal/api/analyze_product",
    data={"description": "A premium wireless headphone with noise cancellation"},
    files={"image": open("product.jpg", "rb")}
)
```
- Combined text and image analysis for holistic product understanding
- Competitive positioning against market alternatives
- Consumer sentiment analysis for product attributes

### Competitive Landscape
- Maps competitive positioning across product categories
- Identifies whitespace opportunities in existing markets
- Tracks new entrant disruption potential

## Technologies Used
